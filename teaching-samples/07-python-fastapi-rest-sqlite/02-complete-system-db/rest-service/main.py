"""
The complete system, part 1: the RESTful service.

The service keeps the actors and the countries in a SQLite database, and offers them
to its clients as JSON. Both resources now have all the operations (reading, adding,
changing, deleting). The service is built in layers:

    routers       receive the requests and send the answers        (the folder routers)
    repositories  read and write the database                      (the folder repositories)
    models        the classes mapped to the tables                 (the folder models)
    DTOs          the shape of the data that travels to clients    (the folder dtos)

Start it with      python main.py
and then open      http://localhost:8001/docs

The second part of the system, the web application (the folder web-app),
is a client of this service - so start the service first.
